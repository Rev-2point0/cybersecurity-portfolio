# Controls and compliance checklist

**Controls assessment checklist**

|   Yes |   No | Control | Explanation |
| ----- | -----| ------- | ----------- |
|  | X | Least Privilege |currently all employees have access to customer data. Privileges need to be limited to reduce the risk of a breach or malicious insider. |
|  | X | Disaster recovery plans | currently no disaster recovery plan in place. These need to be implemented to ensure business continuity |
|  | X | Password policies | employee password requirements are minimal which could allow a threat actor to more easily access secure data |
|  | X | Separation of duties | needs to be implemented to reduce the possibility of fraud/access to critical data.  |
| X |  | Firewall |  |
|  | X | Intrusion detection system (IDS) | the IT dept needs to put an IDS in place to help identify possible intrusions. |
|  | X | Backups | The IT dept needs to have backups of important data in case of a breach, to ensure business continuity. |
| X |  | Antivirus software |  |
|  | X | Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention for legacy systems | currently these systems are monitored and maintained, but there is not a regular schedule in place for this task and procedures/policies related to intervention are unclear, leaving systems at risk of a breach. |
|  | X | Encryption | Encryption is not currently used. Implementing encryption would provide greater confidentiality of sensitive information. |
|  | X | Password management system | There’s no password management system currently in place. Implementing this would improve IT dept/employee productivity in the case of password issues. |
| X |  | Locks (offices, storefront, warehouse) |  |
| X |  | Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance |  |
| X |  | Fire detection/prevention (fire alarm, sprinkler system, etc.) |  |
